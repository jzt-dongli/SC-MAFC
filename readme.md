### Abstract ###
Multi-attribute features such as appearance, optical flow, and pose have been widely applied in the field of Video Anomaly Detection. However, existing studies often overlook the semantic consistency between these features, which limits the potential relationships among different attributes and hinders the effective utilization of this information in anomaly detection. To address this issue, we propose a Semantic Consistency framework based on Multi-Attribute Feature Complementarity (SC-MAFC). Specifically, we design a three-branch encoder-decoder network to separately encode and predict appearance, optical flow, and pose features. By comparing the consistency differences between appearance and other attribute features at normal and anomalous moments, we can use these differences as the basis for anomaly detection. To better capture these differences, we introduce a Spatial-Channel Feature Complementarity Module (SCFCM), allowing different attribute features to complement each other and helping the model more accurately understand the semantic consistency of normal events, thus improving its ability to recognize the semantic consistency in normal events. Additionally, to further enhance detection performance, we introduce a memory module to degrade the reconstruction quality of features at anomalous moments, by which large errors are generated in future frame predictions, making anomalies more pronounced and easier to detect.  It was evaluated on three benchmark datasets: UCSD Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech. The method proved effective, achieving AUC scores of 99.4\% on UCSD Ped2, 93.9\% on Avenue, and 84.6\% on ShanghaiTech, demonstrating its robustness in various scenarios.
